<h2>🤞What's HacktoberFest?</h2>

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software. Every October, everyone is encouraged to support open-source by contributing a minimum of 4 pull requests to earn limited-edition SWAG or to plant a tree.

Everyone is invited to participate and contribute regardless of your background or experience. All you need to do is sign-up to participate on the Hacktoberfest website.

HACKTOBERFEST IS FOR EVERYONE. WHETHER IT’S YOUR FIRST TIME—OR YOUR NINTH—IT’S ALMOST TIME TO HACK OUT FOUR PRISTINE PULL/MERGE REQUESTS AND COMPLETE YOUR MISSION FOR OPEN SOURCE.
